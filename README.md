# Weather-Tron Pro
 
## Description
For this challenge we were tasked with making a weather app to check the weather in cities all over the world. After painstakingly solving the criteria specified, Weather-Tron was born. The app looks clean and visually appealing thanks to Bootstrap. The only css styling performed was with bootstrap. Users can search cities globally and those cities are then stored into buttons that the user can use to toggle between recent searches. The information provided by the weather search includes the following: an icon reflecting the weather (rainy or sunny), the date that is being forecasted, the temperature, wind speed, humidity, and even the uvi index for the current day. Languages/methods used: HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and fetching a server-side API to print the data.

## Installation
No installation required, access the application at the live URL via this link: https://garretthilberling.github.io/weather-tron-pro/

## Usage
The functionality is simple: the user inputs their desired city and the forecast for the next six days is printed to the page. The city that was searched is then stored into a button that the user can use to toggle back to that search more easily.
